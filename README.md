## Usage
# Zen-of-JavaScript Example

```js
// Import Zen-of-JS
const { zen, print } = require('zen_of_javascript');

// Print all lines at once
console.log('All at once:\n', zen);

// Line-by-line scrolling (Python-style)

print(300);   // faster scrolling, 300ms per line

Prefer composition over inheritance.
Keep it DRY.
Test your assumptions.
Error handling is not optional.
Use promises or async/await wisely.
Avoid callback hell.
Modules are your friends.
Console.log wisely.

Enjoy coding.
